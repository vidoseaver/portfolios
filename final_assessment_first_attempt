Challenge: "What Can I Make?"

Notes:

TDD a little loose. Writing some functionality, then writing test
Nice job anticipating test results
Ruby syntax: knew how to set default value of Hash (Hash.new(0)), could have implemented += in restock
Finished baseline in 25 min (good)
Shaky application of testing principles:
Before naming tests, get clear on exactly what's being tested ("we can add cheese" actually tests that "we can check stock")
Try to avoid changing tests once they're written
Adding recipes to cookbook started to feel rushed, haphazard
Reading errors more closely
1. Ruby Syntax & API

3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts
2. Completion and Progress

2.5

3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.
2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.
3. Testing

*

3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
4. Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
5. Collaboration

2: Developer asks detailed questions when progress slows or stops
6. Enumerable & Collections
N/A
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections
