# Vido Seaver - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

At the begining of the mod we were asked to write down some goals for ourselves in the module. I wanted to make a priority of thinking before speaking as to not alienate any of my peers, I wanted to stay coginicent that their are many ways to skin a cat and not get caught on one way of doing, things, I wanted to survive. And I wanted to fill my little black book. With notes. As far as I know I haven't pissed anyone off too much. I'm still here and I have an (even) greater respect for all that I don't know. However I still have 4 pages left at the back of my book untouched. While, its easy to say its almost there the truth is its not a complete. It's a fitting metaphor for where I am at the end of the module. I could move on, get a new black book and start over. Or I can fill in the gaps and finish my goal. There the question of time vs benefit. I'm not clear on the answer.


### Areas of Emphasis
I think everyone would agree our ability to code grown tremandously. Spelling less so. 
I've learned alot about things I've never knew existed(terminal, pry, mac's in general, classes, tdd) and gained a better understanding of how big the developer world really is. It's kind of like the universe. Everytime you learn something you realize the amount to learn is exponentially larger. Somehow though it seems less daunting.

Things that I need to get better at:
Organization,Typing, Slowing down, TDD,

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:

42 tests, 4 pending
Some clusters of tests but not a lot of cohesion / difficult to follow the story
What does it do? "Not much." It takes your name and generates a board object.
Overall struggled with approach/organization
Tried to make it "just work" without really focusing on scale/quality, but that didn't work
Work on some exercisms the next few days to practice building small things
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution
2. Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
4. REPL Interface

1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult
5. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

#### Flashcards


Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Repo: https://github.com/vidoseaver/flashcards

Notes:

Outdated files and comments need to be cleaned up
Nice test suite
Only complete through iteration 5
Some opportunities for refactoring
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1. Functional Expectations

2: Application is usable but has some missing functionality.
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.
5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Cdunagan05/black_thursday)
* [DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17DnjKetuxhu0_46rJkkCGMpR-dcMFKZpTK-pT_Ue5f8/edit#)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday)
* [README](https://github.com/vidoseaver/black_thursday/blob/master/README.md)

##Description

Black Thursday was our final project in Module 1 at the Turing School of Software & Design. It is a program that is desined to take in CSV files - comma seperated value files - commonly made in xcel and other spreadsheet programs - parse the information into ruby objects. Relationships are built between the objects with the sales engine acting as the queen-pin taking and passing information from various repositories which in turn store track indvidual objects. The sales analyst class does the majority of the meta-data analysis.



Notes:
* Test suite with 174 examples, all passing 
* Sanitation passes with no errors 
* Test harness passing through 4 (i0-4)
* Some opportunities for refactoring: long methods (2), wonky if/else statement
* Overall fairly clean implementation of most functionality
* Test suite could benefit from mocking, sufficient to validate most functionality
* Would like to see integration testing of features as ​_supplement_​ to isolation testing

### 1. Functional Expectations
3.5
* 4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design
* 3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2.5 
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### 6. Code Sanitation
The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...
* 4: Zero complaints
##Feedback
Working with Vido was an epic journey that we took together throughout the week and a half of Black Thursday.  Vido was not afraid of speaking his mind with his ideas, but also would take ideas that were given to him and try to implement them.  His work habit was fantastic.  He was not afraid to work on our program until the sun came up.  His problem solving skills, however unorthodox, were excellent.  Vido is an extremely intelligent person, and I’m excited to see the programmer he will turn into.  A constructive criticism for Vido is him working on making his thought process clearer and simpler.  He was always willing to explaining his ideas, there was no question about that, but even still, some of his ideas were difficult for me to follow.   Vido is an excellent partner to have in many many ways, and he was crucial to our completing of Black Thursday.

During our first pair project, we approached the project with a lot of enthusiasm. We started with a quick DTR, and met on the weekend to hash out our approach. Vido has a lot of energy and is dedicated to solving problems that lay in front of him. Some areas that can be worked on would be general organization when starting a project. Things like white-boarding, outlining, or setting small goals and deadlines could carry projects further in the future. 
I feel that we both learned a lot from our project and how we both could improve with paired projects in the future. Vido is a great person with a knack for learning, and I hope that it carries him far.

### Giving Feedback
Pairing with Gabi Proceell on Nitewriter. 

This was our first pairing project and second evaluated project.  We struggled with just about everything, github, white_boarding, pairing planning and sharing workload. Despite the crash and burn of the project we stayed amicable and I don't think it overshadows our relationship.. To me that was the real win. In a project recap we discussed how we should have DTR'd better. I think it would also help for you to work on trusting what you know and confidently communicating it. I think this is how feedback is supposed to look….

Pairing with Chase for Black Thursday

Needless to say Black Thursday, is a trying experience. When most Turing students are surveyed they will respond with something along the lines of "I'd love to help you but i blacked that out".  Working with Chase on it was a pleasure. He was the driver the majority of the project. He is remarkably good at following and understanding my erratic ass navigation. We wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't for his debugging skills. Often he'd find the error before I even knew what line to check. I think pairing with him certainly allowed me to operate in my area's of strength with all cylinders firing. It's something I rarely find. We stayed humorous and on the same page even as the deadline loomed and we were putting in consecutive 14 hour days. The only thing I would suggest having finished our project is follow your gut and speak up if you see a potential bug. It could save day(z).

Kris Sparks on pry

Kris reached and asked me for some feedback on a session he and Pat Wentz led on pry for mod one. As I understand it feedback is supposed to contain something that someone can work on so they can improve. If that’s the case then I don’t really think this will count because Kris has been amazingly helpful throughout the mod. From being an irreplaceable part of Hopper posse, to helping with white-boarding on battle-ship, the pry session and just generally making himself available as resource. He’s friendly, understanding and entirely approachable. I wouldn’t change a thing. Thanks Kris.

### Playing a Part

I donated a community siracha, repped Turing and went and crushed data entry for that start up at the begining of the mod and helped build the front ends furniture
