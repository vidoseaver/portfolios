### Giving Feedback
Pairing with Gabi Proceell on Nitewriter. 

This was our first pairing project and second evaluated project.  We struggled with just about everything, github, white_boarding, pairing planning and sharing workload. Despite the crash and burn of the project we stayed amicable and I don't think it overshadows our relationship.. To me that was the real win. In a project recap we discussed how we should have DTR'd better. I think it would also help for you to work on trusting what you know and confidently communicating it. I think this is how feedback is supposed to lookâ€¦.
