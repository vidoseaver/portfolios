Challenge: #1: Shopping List

Notes:

* started with test
* made setup method to create object used throughout testing
* check indenting used for method definitions -- caused problems with recognizing missing `end`
* some syntax/typing errors -- able to correct, but be diligent about checking what you're typing
* `@ingredients.Hash.new{""}` syntax inside of restock method
* make sure to read error messages closely to check the class/file/line where method should be
* able to predict error messages before running test
* some confusion with taking written instructions and translating them into tests in option 1
* comfortable with hash syntax (both building a hash and accessing values)
* comfortable with syntax of blocks for enumerables
* some trouble implementing shopping list iterating through array of recipes and combining ingredients into one hash


#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 2.5 - completed checking the shopping list but not printing the shopping list in 75 min

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.
* 2: Developer completes baseline but struggles to progress on optional challenges.

#### 3. Testing

* 2.5 - able to write tests with assertions, but needed guidance in order to digest specifications and write tests that validate functionality effectively

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design
* 2: Developer uses and writes tests to guide development, but implements more functionality than the tests cover

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 2.5 - able to explain function of each, map, and reduce, but did not start with reduce (which would be the appropriate approach for the problem)

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
