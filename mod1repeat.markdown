### Areas of Emphasis

I came into this module with mixed feelings, it was difficult seeing my peers from 1606 move on without me. My goal was try to play more active roll helping others this time around and that was pretty rewarding. I wouldn't say it was a breeze this time but I've defintely been comfortable. I look at it as a polishing module, not as much new content, more time to explore and to teach others.

A binary search tree, that took in a txt file by line and made nodes from the rating, included search and sort, delete, functionality.

Notes:

20 tests, all pass
unusual insertion strategy but it works
some good effort in refactoring
fit the wild Vido style into the framework -- and succeeded

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event-Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Black thursday at the end of last mod I learned the importance of puttin in work on the weekends. I had friends in town and didn't put in the work on event-reporter I should have. I built my repl for it at four am morning off. I got it done but not how I had wanted to. Honestly the project wasn't where I wanted it to be. 

1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations
2. REPL Interface

4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
4. Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
5. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
6. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
7. HTML and Style

4: Uses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

#### Complete-Me

I really enjoyed this project, we crushed it. Ali is wicked smart and really easy to work with. I think we finished it with two days to spare.

Notes:

Base expectations complete plus 1 extension
Solid testing suite with unit and integrations tests
Intentional division of responsibilities between classes AND methods; demonstrates thoughtful design and sound implementation of that design
Ruby style: some small issues that held project back from "demonstrates excellent knowledge of" style, but overall relatively clean and stylistically consistent project. Nice job!
Only had use for two enumerables, chosen appropriately. Project's execution doesn't lend itself to a 4 in this category.
Only bug: count continues to increment with duplicate words. Does not affect trie structure.

1. Functional Expectations
4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

2. Test-Driven Development
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
